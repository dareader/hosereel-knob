# Hosereel Knob

This design is a replacement knob for a wall mounted hose reel marketed by Kingfisher.

The same or similar products are also available under the Marksman and Gardenpro branding.

* Kingfisher / GardenPro 615PRO
* Marksman 20m Hose Reel Set 70143C

The original knob is a clip-in (press-fitting) hollow knob. It fails quickly with use.

This two-part replacement is more durable, and is also slightly larger making it easier to use.

The design files are configured for use with a countersunk M6 x 20mm bolt.

## Printing

Suggested print:

* PETG
* 35% infill with a strong 3D pattern (eg, Cura's "Quarter Cubic")
* 0.12mm layer height
* Support is required for the key recess
